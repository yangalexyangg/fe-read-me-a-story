# Read Me A Story

Read Me A Story is an app that allows family members to record, upload and playback bedtime stories for young children in the family when they are unable to read them in person.

A parent can sign up to the app, create a family group and invite their partner or relatives to join. Family members can then choose to record and upload stories, or view a list of stories created by the family. Stories can be selected from the list and played back to the child.
